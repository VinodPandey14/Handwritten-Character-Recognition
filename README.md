# 📝 Handwritten Character Recognition (HCR) using CNN

This project is a **handwritten character recognition web app** built using **Flask, TensorFlow, and JavaScript**. It uses a **CNN model trained on the EMNIST dataset** to predict characters from user-drawn inputs.

## 🚀 Features
- **Web-based Drawing Canvas**: Users can draw characters.
- **CNN Model for Prediction**: Trained on the **EMNIST dataset** (47 classes: digits & letters).
- **Top-2 Predictions with Probability**: Shows the best match and an alternative guess.
- **Interactive UI**: Clear and Predict buttons, smooth drawing strokes.

## 🎯 Model Details
